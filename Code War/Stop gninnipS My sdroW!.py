# Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string,
# but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings
# passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more
# than one word is present.

# Examples:

# spinWords( "Hey fellow warriors" ) => returns "Hey wollef sroirraw"

# spinWords( "This is a test") => returns "This is a test"

# spinWords( "This is another test" )=> returns "This is rehtona test"

x = input("String: ")
